# 🔧 Persistent 404 Error - Complete Solution

## ❌ Issue: 404 error still persists on Vercel

Since the build is working locally but Vercel still shows 404, this indicates a deployment configuration issue.

## ✅ Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Delete and Redeploy on Vercel

1. **Delete Current Project:**
   - Go to Vercel dashboard
   - Find your `event-org-frontend` project
   - Click "Settings" → "Delete Project"

2. **Create Fresh Deployment:**
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import `event-org` repository
   - **CRITICAL**: Set Root Directory to `frontend`
   - Click "Deploy"

### Option 2: Use Netlify (Recommended Alternative)

**Netlify is more reliable for Next.js apps:**

1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New site from Git"
4. Connect your `event-org` repository
5. **Build settings:**
   - Base directory: `frontend`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `frontend/.next`
6. Click "Deploy site"

### Option 3: Use Render (All-in-One)

1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Web Service"
4. Connect your `event-org` repository
5. **Settings:**
   - Root Directory: `frontend`
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Start Command: `npm start`
6. Click "Create Web Service"

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### Check Vercel Build Logs:
1. Go to your Vercel project
2. Click on the latest deployment
3. Check "Build Logs" tab
4. Look for any errors or warnings

### Verify Environment Variables:
Make sure these are set in Vercel:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.vercel.app
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Check Domain Configuration:
- Ensure the domain is properly configured
- Try accessing the raw Vercel URL (not custom domain)

## 🚀 Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test locally (should work)
cd frontend
npm run build
npm start

# Visit http://localhost:3000
# If this works, the issue is with Vercel deployment
```

## 📦 Alternative: Use Deployment Package

If all else fails, use the local deployment package:

1. **Extract** `event-org-deployment.zip` (available locally)
2. **Upload to Netlify:**
   - Drag & drop the `frontend` folder
   - Set build command: `npm run build`
   - Set publish directory: `.next`

## 🌐 Expected Working URLs

After successful deployment:
- **Netlify**: `https://event-org-frontend.netlify.app`
- **Render**: `https://event-org-frontend.onrender.com`
- **Vercel**: `https://event-org-frontend.vercel.app`

- Environment variable problems
- Domain configuration errors
- Caching issues

## 📋 Recommended Action Plan

1. **Try Netlify first** (most reliable for Next.js)
2. **If Netlify works**, the issue is with Vercel configuration
3. **Use Render as backup** if Netlify has issues
4. **Keep Vercel for backend** (usually works fine for Node.js)
