# üîç Netlify Deployment Status Check

## ‚è≥ "In Progress" Status - What to Do

### 1. **Check Netlify Dashboard**
- Go to your Netlify dashboard
- Look for the deployment status
- Check if there are any error messages

### 2. **Common Causes of "In Progress" Status**

**A. DNS Propagation (Most Common)**
- Netlify needs time to propagate DNS changes
- Can take 5-15 minutes for full activation
- The site might be live but status still showing "in progress"

**B. Build Still Running**
- Sometimes the UI doesn't update immediately
- Check the build logs for completion

**C. Cache Issues**
- Browser cache might show old status
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)

### 3. **Quick Checks**

**Test Your Site URL:**
- Try accessing your Netlify URL directly
- If it loads, the site is actually live
- The status might just be a UI delay

**Check Build Logs:**
- Go to your Netlify dashboard
- Click on the deployment
- Check the build logs for any errors

### 4. **If Site is Actually Live**

**Your app should be accessible at:**
- `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`
- Test the main pages:
  - Home page
  - Login page
  - Dashboard
  - Create poll

### 5. **If Still Having Issues**

**Try These Steps:**
1. **Wait 10-15 minutes** for DNS propagation
2. **Clear browser cache** and try again
3. **Check Netlify dashboard** for error messages
4. **Try accessing the site** directly via URL

### 6. **Success Indicators**

‚úÖ **Site loads without errors**
‚úÖ **All pages are accessible**
‚úÖ **No 404 errors**
‚úÖ **Login/register forms work**

**üéâ If your site is accessible via URL, it's successfully deployed regardless of the status indicator!**
